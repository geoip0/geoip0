## About GeoIP0

GeoIP0 is a useful tool for looking up geolocation information corresponding to IP addresses. The service is able to integrate into serverless platforms, utilising the platform's Geo IP context, and also supports connecting to multiple publicly available free databases. It provides basic geolocation data such as country, province, city, latitude and longitude. In addition, the GeoIP API service supports self-hosting, making it easy for users to deploy and manage it according to their needs.
